# Time-Series-Forecasting-Tensorfllow
Time Series Forecasting with TensorFlow This repository contains code and data for a time series forecasting project using TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to predict future values of a time series based on historical data.

# Key Features
The project uses TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, for modeling and prediction.
The code includes data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps for time series forecasting.
The models used in this project include popular time series forecasting models such as LSTM and GRU.
The project uses publicly available time series data, making it easy for others to reproduce the results or build upon the work.

# How to Use
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The repository includes a requirements.txt file that lists all dependencies.

The data directory includes the time series data used in the project. The src directory contains all code related to data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

To run the code, navigate to the src directory and run the main.py script. This will preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.
